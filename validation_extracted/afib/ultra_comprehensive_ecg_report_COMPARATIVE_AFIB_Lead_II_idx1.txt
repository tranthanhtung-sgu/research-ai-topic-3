### B. Intervals and Durations (CASE) ###
- RR Mean (ms): 435.24ms (StdDev: 80.16, N: 21)
- PP Mean (ms): 820.00ms (StdDev: 354.68, N: 10)
- PR Mean (ms): 140.00ms (StdDev: 28.67, N: 9)
- QRS Mean (ms): 80.00ms (StdDev: 0.00, N: 1)
- QT Mean (ms): 305.00ms (StdDev: 5.00, N: 2)
- QTc Mean (Bazett): 411.95 (StdDev: 30.37, N: 2)

### C. Amplitudes (from Cleaned ECG - CASE) ###
- P Peak Amp: Mean=-0.057, Std=0.050 (N=11) arb. units
- Q Peak Amp: Mean=-0.131, Std=0.030 (N=21) arb. units
- R Peak Amp: Mean=0.604, Std=0.164 (N=22) arb. units
- S Peak Amp: Mean=-0.077, Std=0.020 (N=21) arb. units
- T Peak Amp: Mean=0.042, Std=0.053 (N=3) arb. units

### D. ST-Segment Analysis (Basic - CASE) ###
- ST Mean Dev (J+60ms): 0.052 arb. units (Std: 0.029, N: 3)

### E. Axis Information (CASE - General Note) ###
- QRS Axis, P-wave axis, T-wave axis: Full calculation requires multiple specific leads (e.g., I & aVF). This report focuses on single-lead parameters derived from the chosen lead.

### F. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) & Rate (CASE) ###
- Avg HR (from RR): 137.86 bpm
  **HRV Metrics (nk.hrv() - CASE):** (Note: Freq-domain & non-linear metrics need longer, stable recordings)
  (See Comparative Poincaré plot: AFIB_1_poincare_Lead_II_idx1.png if HRV params available for both conditions)

### G. Signal Quality (CASE) ###
- Mean ECG Quality: 0.608 (NeuroKit method)

### H. Cardiac Phase Information (CASE - General Note) ###
- Cardiac phase plotting is not included in this comparative version for brevity. See NeuroKit examples if specific phase plots are needed.

### I. Representative Heartbeats (CASE - Superimposed) ###
- See comparative plot: AFIB_segmented_heartbeats_comparative_Lead_II_idx1.png (shows superimposed beats and average for both conditions).

==============================
### Clinical Summary Suggestion (AFIB CASE) ###
Key AFib indicators to check (Compare CASE vs REFERENCE in plots):
  - Rhythm: Irregularly irregular RR intervals (high HRV_SDNN, RMSSD). Check Comparative Poincaré plot & RR Distribution.
  - P-waves: Often absent/fibrillatory. Check P-wave counts & morphology (Sections A, C).
  - Rate: Ventricular rate variable, often rapid if untreated.
  - QRS Duration: Usually normal unless BBB.
Please correlate with full clinical picture. This is not a diagnostic tool.
