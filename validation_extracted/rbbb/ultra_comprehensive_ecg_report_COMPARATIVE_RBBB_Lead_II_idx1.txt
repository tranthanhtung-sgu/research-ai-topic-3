- R_Peaks detected: 29
- R_Offsets detected: 6
- S_Peaks detected: 28
- T_Onsets detected: 6
- T_Peaks detected: 6
- T_Offsets detected: 6

### B. Intervals and Durations (CASE) ###
- RR Mean (ms): 342.14ms (StdDev: 41.26, N: 28)
- PP Mean (ms): 607.14ms (StdDev: 407.04, N: 14)
- PR Mean (ms): 96.00ms (StdDev: 14.97, N: 5)
- QRS Mean (ms): 132.50ms (StdDev: 32.69, N: 4)
- QT Mean (ms): 433.33ms (StdDev: 158.39, N: 3)
- QTc Mean (Bazett): 778.29 (StdDev: 284.49, N: 3)

### C. Amplitudes (from Cleaned ECG - CASE) ###
- P Peak Amp: Mean=0.096, Std=0.085 (N=15) arb. units
- Q Peak Amp: Mean=-0.048, Std=0.037 (N=27) arb. units
- R Peak Amp: Mean=0.383, Std=0.118 (N=29) arb. units
- S Peak Amp: Mean=-0.280, Std=0.054 (N=28) arb. units
- T Peak Amp: Mean=-0.090, Std=0.035 (N=6) arb. units

### D. ST-Segment Analysis (Basic - CASE) ###
- ST Mean Dev (J+60ms): -0.117 arb. units (Std: 0.078, N: 6)

### E. Axis Information (CASE - General Note) ###
- QRS Axis, P-wave axis, T-wave axis: Full calculation requires multiple specific leads (e.g., I & aVF). This report focuses on single-lead parameters derived from the chosen lead.

### F. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) & Rate (CASE) ###
- Avg HR (from RR): 175.37 bpm
  **HRV Metrics (nk.hrv() - CASE):** (Note: Freq-domain & non-linear metrics need longer, stable recordings)
  (See Comparative PoincarÃ© plot: RBBB_1_poincare_Lead_II_idx1.png if HRV params available for both conditions)

### G. Signal Quality (CASE) ###
- Mean ECG Quality: 0.695 (NeuroKit method)

### H. Cardiac Phase Information (CASE - General Note) ###
- Cardiac phase plotting is not included in this comparative version for brevity. See NeuroKit examples if specific phase plots are needed.

### I. Representative Heartbeats (CASE - Superimposed) ###
- See comparative plot: RBBB_segmented_heartbeats_comparative_Lead_II_idx1.png (shows superimposed beats and average for both conditions).

==============================
### Clinical Summary Suggestion (RBBB CASE) ###
Key RBBB indicators to check (Compare CASE vs REFERENCE in plots):
  - QRS Duration: Prolonged (>120ms) with characteristic morphology
  - QRS Morphology: RSR' pattern in V1-V2, wide S waves in I, V5-V6
  - ST-T Changes: Secondary repolarization abnormalities
  - Axis: Usually normal
Please correlate with full clinical picture. This is not a diagnostic tool.
