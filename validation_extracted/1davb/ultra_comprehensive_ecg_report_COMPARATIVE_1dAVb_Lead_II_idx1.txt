- T_Onsets detected: 9
- T_Peaks detected: 9
- T_Offsets detected: 9

### B. Intervals and Durations (CASE) ###
- RR Mean (ms): 1021.25ms (StdDev: 5.99, N: 8)
- PP Mean (ms): 1020.00ms (StdDev: 12.25, N: 8)
- PR Mean (ms): 101.25ms (StdDev: 37.56, N: 8)
- QRS Mean (ms): 140.00ms (StdDev: 0.00, N: 1)
- QT Mean (ms): 531.25ms (StdDev: 38.55, N: 8)
- QTc Mean (Bazett): 526.01 (StdDev: 38.10, N: 8)

### C. Amplitudes (from Cleaned ECG - CASE) ###
- P Peak Amp: Mean=0.027, Std=0.020 (N=9) arb. units
- Q Peak Amp: Mean=-0.116, Std=0.021 (N=8) arb. units
- R Peak Amp: Mean=0.581, Std=0.034 (N=9) arb. units
- S Peak Amp: Mean=-0.053, Std=0.020 (N=8) arb. units
- T Peak Amp: Mean=0.288, Std=0.022 (N=9) arb. units

### D. ST-Segment Analysis (Basic - CASE) ###
- ST Mean Dev (J+60ms): -0.032 arb. units (Std: 0.022, N: 9)

### E. Axis Information (CASE - General Note) ###
- QRS Axis, P-wave axis, T-wave axis: Full calculation requires multiple specific leads (e.g., I & aVF). This report focuses on single-lead parameters derived from the chosen lead.

### F. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) & Rate (CASE) ###
- Avg HR (from RR): 58.75 bpm
  Not enough R-peaks for full HRV (CASE - need >10).

### G. Signal Quality (CASE) ###
- Mean ECG Quality: 0.604 (NeuroKit method)

### H. Cardiac Phase Information (CASE - General Note) ###
- Cardiac phase plotting is not included in this comparative version for brevity. See NeuroKit examples if specific phase plots are needed.

### I. Representative Heartbeats (CASE - Superimposed) ###
- See comparative plot: 1dAVb_segmented_heartbeats_comparative_Lead_II_idx1.png (shows superimposed beats and average for both conditions).

==============================
### Clinical Summary Suggestion (1dAVb CASE) ###
Key 1dAVb indicators to check (Compare CASE vs REFERENCE in plots):
  - Rhythm: Irregularly irregular RR intervals (high HRV_SDNN, RMSSD). Check Comparative Poincar√© plot & RR Distribution.
  - P-waves: Often absent/fibrillatory. Check P-wave counts & morphology (Sections A, C).
  - Rate: Ventricular rate variable, often rapid if untreated.
  - QRS Duration: Usually normal unless BBB.
Please correlate with full clinical picture. This is not a diagnostic tool.
