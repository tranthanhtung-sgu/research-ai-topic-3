**Normal Condition ECG**

**Definition:** The physiological rhythm originating from the SA node, conducting normally through the heart. Represents the baseline healthy electrical activity.

**ECG Characteristics :**

* **Rate:** 60–100 bpm (adults at rest).
* **Rhythm:** Regular (consistent P–P and R–R intervals).
* **P waves:** Uniform morphology, upright in I, II, aVF; inverted in aVR; one P wave precedes each QRS complex.
* **PR Interval:** Constant, 0.12–0.20 seconds.
* **QRS Duration:** Narrow, typically < 0.10–0.12 seconds.
* **P : QRS Ratio:** 1 : 1.

**Atrial Fibrillation (AFib)**

**Definition:** AF is a chaotic, multi-wavelet re-entry arrhythmia in the atria. Because hundreds of foci fire simultaneously, organised atrial depolarisation never occurs and the AV node is bombarded by irregular impulses.

**ECG Characteristics :**

* **Rhythm / Heart rate:** Irregularly-irregular ventricular response; most patients with untreated (“rapid-AF”) conduct at ≈ 110 – 160 bpm, but the atrial mass is really firing chaotically at ≈ 350 – 600 bpm.
* **P waves:** No discrete P waves; coarse or fine fibrillatory (f) waves replace the isoelectric line.
* **P : QRS Ratio:** None (AV node receives a barrage of impulses).
* **PR Interval:** Not measurable.
* **QRS Duration:** Usually < 120 ms; will widen only if a pre-existing bundle-branch block or rate-related aberrancy is present.

**Atrial Flutter**

**Definition:** Rapid but organized atrial electrical activity, typically from a large re-entrant circuit (usually in the right atrium).

**ECG Characteristics :**

* **Atrial rate:** ≈ 300 bpm (range 240 – 350).
* **Ventricular rate:** Determined by the AV block ratio
  • 2 : 1 block ⇒ ≈ 150 bpm (most common)
  • 3 : 1 block ⇒ ≈ 100 bpm, etc.
* **P waves:** Absent; replaced by saw-tooth flutter (F) waves best seen in leads II, III, aVF.
* **P : QRS Ratio:** Typically 2 : 1 but may be 3 : 1, 4 : 1 or variable.
* **PR Interval:** Not measurable (no discrete P waves).
* **QRS Duration:** < 120 ms unless concurrent bundle-branch block.

**First-Degree Atrioventricular (AV) Block**

**Definition:** Sinus impulses reach the ventricles, but conduction through the AV node or His bundle is slowed, so every beat is delayed but none are dropped.

**ECG Characteristics :**

* **Heart rate:** Normal sinus rate (60 – 100 bpm) unless another rhythm abnormality co-exists.
* **P waves:** Normal morphology; every P followed by QRS.
* **P : QRS Ratio:** 1 : 1.
* **PR Interval:** Prolonged > 200 ms (≥ 5 small squares), constant from beat to beat.
* **QRS Duration:** Normal (< 120 ms).

**Right Bundle-Branch Block (RBBB)**

**Definition:** In RBBB, activation of the right ventricle must spread from the left, so right-sided depolarisation is delayed.

**ECG Characteristics :**

* **Heart rate & P waves:** Determined by the underlying rhythm (often normal sinus).
* **PR Interval:** Normal unless another AV-nodal disorder co-exists.
* **QRS Duration:** ≥ 120 ms.
* **Morphology:**
  • rSR′ or “M-shaped” QRS in V₁–V₃
  • Broad, slurred S-wave in leads I, aVL, V₅–V₆
* **P : QRS Ratio:** 1 : 1 (conduction block is infranodal).

**Left Bundle-Branch Block (LBBB)**

**Definition:** In LBBB, the left ventricular conduction system is blocked, so depolarisation proceeds from right to left across the septum, greatly widening the QRS.

**ECG Characteristics :**

* **Heart rate & P waves:** Depend on underlying rhythm (usually sinus).
* **PR Interval:** Normal unless concurrent AV-nodal disease.
* **QRS Duration:** ≥ 120 ms with distinctive shape.
* **Morphology:**
  • Deep, broad S-wave (or QS) in V₁–V₂
  • Broad, often notched R-wave in V₅–V₆, I, aVL
  • “Appropriate discordance” – ST/T changes opposite the major QRS deflection
* **P : QRS Ratio:** 1 : 1.
