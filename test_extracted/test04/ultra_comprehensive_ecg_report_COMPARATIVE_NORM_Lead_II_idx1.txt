- S_Peaks detected: 20
- T_Onsets detected: 17
- T_Peaks detected: 17
- T_Offsets detected: 17

### B. Intervals and Durations (CASE) ###
- RR Mean (ms): 444.00ms (StdDev: 156.28, N: 20)
- PP Mean (ms): 1346.67ms (StdDev: 934.78, N: 6)
- PR Mean (ms): 80.00ms (StdDev: 0.00, N: 5)
- QRS Mean (ms): 106.67ms (StdDev: 31.97, N: 6)
- QT Mean (ms): 310.00ms (StdDev: 184.80, N: 4)
- QTc Mean (Bazett): 486.13 (StdDev: 287.48, N: 4)

### C. Amplitudes (from Cleaned ECG - CASE) ###
- P Peak Amp: Mean=0.100, Std=0.034 (N=7) arb. units
- Q Peak Amp: Mean=0.029, Std=0.042 (N=20) arb. units
- R Peak Amp: Mean=0.239, Std=0.020 (N=21) arb. units
- S Peak Amp: Mean=-0.324, Std=0.032 (N=20) arb. units
- T Peak Amp: Mean=0.076, Std=0.052 (N=17) arb. units

### D. ST-Segment Analysis (Basic - CASE) ###
- ST Mean Dev (J+60ms): -0.085 arb. units (Std: 0.094, N: 17)

### E. Axis Information (CASE - General Note) ###
- QRS Axis, P-wave axis, T-wave axis: Full calculation requires multiple specific leads (e.g., I & aVF). This report focuses on single-lead parameters derived from the chosen lead.

### F. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) & Rate (CASE) ###
- Avg HR (from RR): 135.14 bpm
  **HRV Metrics (nk.hrv() - CASE):** (Note: Freq-domain & non-linear metrics need longer, stable recordings)
  (See Comparative PoincarÃ© plot: NORM_1_poincare_Lead_II_idx1.png if HRV params available for both conditions)

### G. Signal Quality (CASE) ###
- Mean ECG Quality: 0.624 (NeuroKit method)

### H. Cardiac Phase Information (CASE - General Note) ###
- Cardiac phase plotting is not included in this comparative version for brevity. See NeuroKit examples if specific phase plots are needed.

### I. Representative Heartbeats (CASE - Superimposed) ###
- See comparative plot: NORM_segmented_heartbeats_comparative_Lead_II_idx1.png (shows superimposed beats and average for both conditions).

==============================
### Clinical Summary Suggestion (NORM CASE) ###
Key NORM indicators to check (Compare CASE vs REFERENCE in plots):
  - QRS Duration: Prolonged (>120ms) with characteristic morphology
  - QRS Morphology: Broad monophasic R waves in I, aVL, V5-V6; deep S waves in V1-V3
  - ST-T Changes: Secondary repolarization abnormalities
  - Axis: Usually left axis deviation
Please correlate with full clinical picture. This is not a diagnostic tool.
