- T_Onsets detected: 9
- T_Peaks detected: 9
- T_Offsets detected: 9

### B. Intervals and Durations (CASE) ###
- RR Mean (ms): 444.50ms (StdDev: 71.03, N: 20)
- PP Mean (ms): 770.91ms (StdDev: 493.25, N: 11)
- PR Mean (ms): 110.00ms (StdDev: 20.00, N: 8)
- QRS Mean (ms): 135.00ms (StdDev: 46.46, N: 6)
- QT Mean (ms): 603.33ms (StdDev: 124.05, N: 6)
- QTc Mean (Bazett): 899.03 (StdDev: 221.84, N: 6)

### C. Amplitudes (from Cleaned ECG - CASE) ###
- P Peak Amp: Mean=-0.010, Std=0.066 (N=12) arb. units
- Q Peak Amp: Mean=-0.089, Std=0.020 (N=20) arb. units
- R Peak Amp: Mean=0.440, Std=0.066 (N=21) arb. units
- S Peak Amp: Mean=-0.152, Std=0.051 (N=20) arb. units
- T Peak Amp: Mean=-0.006, Std=0.059 (N=9) arb. units

### D. ST-Segment Analysis (Basic - CASE) ###
- ST Mean Dev (J+60ms): -0.011 arb. units (Std: 0.058, N: 8)

### E. Axis Information (CASE - General Note) ###
- QRS Axis, P-wave axis, T-wave axis: Full calculation requires multiple specific leads (e.g., I & aVF). This report focuses on single-lead parameters derived from the chosen lead.

### F. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) & Rate (CASE) ###
- Avg HR (from RR): 134.98 bpm
  **HRV Metrics (nk.hrv() - CASE):** (Note: Freq-domain & non-linear metrics need longer, stable recordings)
  (See Comparative PoincarÃ© plot: NORM_1_poincare_Lead_II_idx1.png if HRV params available for both conditions)

### G. Signal Quality (CASE) ###
- Mean ECG Quality: 0.621 (NeuroKit method)

### H. Cardiac Phase Information (CASE - General Note) ###
- Cardiac phase plotting is not included in this comparative version for brevity. See NeuroKit examples if specific phase plots are needed.

### I. Representative Heartbeats (CASE - Superimposed) ###
- See comparative plot: NORM_segmented_heartbeats_comparative_Lead_II_idx1.png (shows superimposed beats and average for both conditions).

==============================
### Clinical Summary Suggestion (NORM CASE) ###
Key NORM indicators to check (Compare CASE vs REFERENCE in plots):
  - QRS Duration: Prolonged (>120ms) with characteristic morphology
  - QRS Morphology: Broad monophasic R waves in I, aVL, V5-V6; deep S waves in V1-V3
  - ST-T Changes: Secondary repolarization abnormalities
  - Axis: Usually left axis deviation
Please correlate with full clinical picture. This is not a diagnostic tool.
