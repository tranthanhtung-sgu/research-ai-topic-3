- T_Onsets detected: 9
- T_Peaks detected: 9
- T_Offsets detected: 9

### B. Intervals and Durations (CASE) ###
- RR Mean (ms): 802.73ms (StdDev: 96.02, N: 11)
- PP Mean (ms): 805.45ms (StdDev: 96.23, N: 11)
- PR Mean (ms): 121.25ms (StdDev: 10.53, N: 8)
- QRS Mean (ms): 147.14ms (StdDev: 7.00, N: 7)
- QT Mean (ms): 347.78ms (StdDev: 99.64, N: 9)
- QTc Mean (Bazett): 391.88 (StdDev: 122.44, N: 9)

### C. Amplitudes (from Cleaned ECG - CASE) ###
- P Peak Amp: Mean=0.053, Std=0.026 (N=12) arb. units
- Q Peak Amp: Mean=-0.029, Std=0.034 (N=11) arb. units
- R Peak Amp: Mean=0.383, Std=0.134 (N=12) arb. units
- S Peak Amp: Mean=-0.347, Std=0.051 (N=11) arb. units
- T Peak Amp: Mean=0.054, Std=0.046 (N=9) arb. units

### D. ST-Segment Analysis (Basic - CASE) ###
- ST Mean Dev (J+60ms): -0.028 arb. units (Std: 0.030, N: 7)

### E. Axis Information (CASE - General Note) ###
- QRS Axis, P-wave axis, T-wave axis: Full calculation requires multiple specific leads (e.g., I & aVF). This report focuses on single-lead parameters derived from the chosen lead.

### F. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) & Rate (CASE) ###
- Avg HR (from RR): 74.75 bpm
  **HRV Metrics (nk.hrv() - CASE):** (Note: Freq-domain & non-linear metrics need longer, stable recordings)
  (See Comparative PoincarÃ© plot: NORM_1_poincare_Lead_II_idx1.png if HRV params available for both conditions)

### G. Signal Quality (CASE) ###
- Mean ECG Quality: 0.529 (NeuroKit method)

### H. Cardiac Phase Information (CASE - General Note) ###
- Cardiac phase plotting is not included in this comparative version for brevity. See NeuroKit examples if specific phase plots are needed.

### I. Representative Heartbeats (CASE - Superimposed) ###
- See comparative plot: NORM_segmented_heartbeats_comparative_Lead_II_idx1.png (shows superimposed beats and average for both conditions).

==============================
### Clinical Summary Suggestion (NORM CASE) ###
Key NORM indicators to check (Compare CASE vs REFERENCE in plots):
  - QRS Duration: Prolonged (>120ms) with characteristic morphology
  - QRS Morphology: Broad monophasic R waves in I, aVL, V5-V6; deep S waves in V1-V3
  - ST-T Changes: Secondary repolarization abnormalities
  - Axis: Usually left axis deviation
Please correlate with full clinical picture. This is not a diagnostic tool.
