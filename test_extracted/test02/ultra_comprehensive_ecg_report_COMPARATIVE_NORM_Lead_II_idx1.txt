- R_Peaks detected: 9
- R_Offsets detected: 9
- S_Peaks detected: 8
- T_Onsets detected: 9
- T_Peaks detected: 9
- T_Offsets detected: 9

### B. Intervals and Durations (CASE) ###
- RR Mean (ms): 1141.25ms (StdDev: 428.53, N: 8)
- PP Mean (ms): 1130.00ms (StdDev: 442.86, N: 8)
- PR Mean (ms): 113.33ms (StdDev: 12.47, N: 3)
- QRS Mean (ms): 145.00ms (StdDev: 5.00, N: 6)
- QT Mean (ms): 307.50ms (StdDev: 57.39, N: 8)
- QTc Mean (Bazett): 299.30 (StdDev: 71.95, N: 8)

### C. Amplitudes (from Cleaned ECG - CASE) ###
- P Peak Amp: Mean=0.018, Std=0.019 (N=9) arb. units
- Q Peak Amp: Mean=-0.306, Std=0.044 (N=8) arb. units
- R Peak Amp: Mean=0.213, Std=0.012 (N=9) arb. units
- S Peak Amp: Mean=-0.015, Std=0.015 (N=8) arb. units
- T Peak Amp: Mean=0.039, Std=0.021 (N=9) arb. units

### D. ST-Segment Analysis (Basic - CASE) ###
- ST Mean Dev (J+60ms): -0.008 arb. units (Std: 0.016, N: 8)

### E. Axis Information (CASE - General Note) ###
- QRS Axis, P-wave axis, T-wave axis: Full calculation requires multiple specific leads (e.g., I & aVF). This report focuses on single-lead parameters derived from the chosen lead.

### F. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) & Rate (CASE) ###
- Avg HR (from RR): 52.57 bpm
  Not enough R-peaks for full HRV (CASE - need >10).

### G. Signal Quality (CASE) ###
- Mean ECG Quality: 0.643 (NeuroKit method)

### H. Cardiac Phase Information (CASE - General Note) ###
- Cardiac phase plotting is not included in this comparative version for brevity. See NeuroKit examples if specific phase plots are needed.

### I. Representative Heartbeats (CASE - Superimposed) ###
- See comparative plot: NORM_segmented_heartbeats_comparative_Lead_II_idx1.png (shows superimposed beats and average for both conditions).

==============================
### Clinical Summary Suggestion (NORM CASE) ###
Key NORM indicators to check (Compare CASE vs REFERENCE in plots):
  - QRS Duration: Prolonged (>120ms) with characteristic morphology
  - QRS Morphology: Broad monophasic R waves in I, aVL, V5-V6; deep S waves in V1-V3
  - ST-T Changes: Secondary repolarization abnormalities
  - Axis: Usually left axis deviation
Please correlate with full clinical picture. This is not a diagnostic tool.
