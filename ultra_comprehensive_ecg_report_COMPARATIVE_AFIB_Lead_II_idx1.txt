### B. Intervals and Durations (CASE) ###
- RR Mean (ms): 343.33ms (StdDev: 15.63, N: 27)
- PP Mean (ms): 1133.33ms (StdDev: 1100.74, N: 3)
- PR Mean (ms): 130.00ms (StdDev: 0.00, N: 3)
- QRS Mean (ms): 110.00ms (StdDev: 21.60, N: 3)
- QT Mean (ms): 442.50ms (StdDev: 135.53, N: 4)
- QTc Mean (Bazett): 775.64 (StdDev: 237.05, N: 4)

### C. Amplitudes (from Cleaned ECG - CASE) ###
- P Peak Amp: Mean=0.092, Std=0.023 (N=4) arb. units
- Q Peak Amp: Mean=-0.063, Std=0.078 (N=27) arb. units
- R Peak Amp: Mean=0.343, Std=0.063 (N=28) arb. units
- S Peak Amp: Mean=-0.139, Std=0.060 (N=27) arb. units
- T Peak Amp: Mean=0.046, Std=0.049 (N=10) arb. units

### D. ST-Segment Analysis (Basic - CASE) ###
- ST Mean Dev (J+60ms): 0.000 arb. units (Std: 0.037, N: 6)

### E. Axis Information (CASE - General Note) ###
- QRS Axis, P-wave axis, T-wave axis: Full calculation requires multiple specific leads (e.g., I & aVF). This report focuses on single-lead parameters derived from the chosen lead.

### F. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) & Rate (CASE) ###
- Avg HR (from RR): 174.76 bpm
  **HRV Metrics (nk.hrv() - CASE):** (Note: Freq-domain & non-linear metrics need longer, stable recordings)
  (See Comparative Poincaré plot: AFIB_1_poincare_Lead_II_idx1.png if HRV params available for both conditions)

### G. Signal Quality (CASE) ###
- Mean ECG Quality: 0.630 (NeuroKit method)

### H. Cardiac Phase Information (CASE - General Note) ###
- Cardiac phase plotting is not included in this comparative version for brevity. See NeuroKit examples if specific phase plots are needed.

### I. Representative Heartbeats (CASE - Superimposed) ###
- See comparative plot: AFIB_segmented_heartbeats_comparative_Lead_II_idx1.png (shows superimposed beats and average for both conditions).

==============================
### Clinical Summary Suggestion (AFIB CASE) ###
Key AFib indicators to check (Compare CASE vs REFERENCE in plots):
  - Rhythm: Irregularly irregular RR intervals (high HRV_SDNN, RMSSD). Check Comparative Poincaré plot & RR Distribution.
  - P-waves: Often absent/fibrillatory. Check P-wave counts & morphology (Sections A, C).
  - Rate: Ventricular rate variable, often rapid if untreated.
  - QRS Duration: Usually normal unless BBB.
Please correlate with full clinical picture. This is not a diagnostic tool.
