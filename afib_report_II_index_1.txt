## AFib Evidence Report for ECG Lead II (index 1) ##
Successfully loaded ECG data from: /home/tony/neurokit/validation/validation02/validation02.npy
ECG Signal Shape: (12, 1000)
Analyzing Lead: II (index 1)
Sampling Rate: 100 Hz
Signal Duration: 10.00 seconds
------------------------------

### 1. Rhythm / Heart Rate Irregularity ###
- Tachogram: Shows beat-to-beat R-R interval variation. Marked irregularity is a key sign of AFib.
  (See afib_tachogram_II_index_1.png)
- Poincaré Plot: Visualizes R-R interval correlation. A 'fan' or 'comet' shape indicates high irregularity, typical of AFib.
  (See afib_poincare_II_index_1.png)

  Key HRV Metrics (from NeuroKit):
    HRV_MeanNN: 343.33
    HRV_SDNN: 15.93
    HRV_RMSSD: 18.08
    HRV_pNN50: 0.00
    HRV_CVNN: 0.05
    HRV_SD1: 13.04
    HRV_SD2: 18.57
    HRV_SD1SD2: 0.70
  Interpretation: High SDNN, RMSSD, pNN50, CVNN suggest significant heart rate variability. Poincaré SD1 & SD2 quantify scatter.

### 2. P-wave Analysis ###
- Number of R-peaks found: 28
- Number of P-peaks detected by NeuroKit: 4
- Observation: Significantly fewer P-peaks detected than R-peaks, or no P-peaks. This is highly consistent with AFib, where discrete P-waves are absent and replaced by fibrillatory (f) waves.
  Guidance: In AFib, expect no clear, consistent P-waves before QRS complexes. The baseline may show fine or coarse undulations (f-waves).
  (See afib_pwave_detail_II_index_1.png for visual inspection of P-wave area).

### 3. P:QRS Ratio ###
- AFib Characteristic: None (atrial activity is chaotic, not consistently 1:1 with QRS).
- Observation: 4 P-peaks vs 28 R-peaks. A low P:R ratio or absent P-peaks supports AFib.

### 4. PR Interval ###
- AFib Characteristic: Not measurable (due to absence/inconsistency of distinct P-waves).
- Observation: NeuroKit detected 4 P-onsets. In AFib, these are unlikely to be true, consistent P-wave onsets. Any calculated PR interval would be unreliable.

### 5. QRS Duration ###
- QRS onsets/offsets not consistently detected or paired for QRS duration calculation from `info` dict.

==============================
### Clinical Summary Suggestion ###
The analysis of ECG Lead II (index 1) demonstrates features highly suggestive of Atrial Fibrillation:
1. **Markedly Irregular Ventricular Rhythm**: Evidenced by variable R-R intervals on tachogram, dispersed Poincaré plot, and elevated HRV metrics (e.g., SDNN, RMSSD).
2. **Absence of Distinct P-waves**: Detected P-waves are sparse or absent relative to QRS complexes, consistent with chaotic atrial activity. Visual inspection likely shows fibrillatory waves instead of organized P-waves.
3. **Unmeasurable PR Interval**: Due to the lack of clear and consistent P-waves.
4. **QRS Duration**: Appears potentially wide or unassessable (see details), which is common in AFib unless complicated by other conduction abnormalities.

These findings strongly support further clinical evaluation for Atrial Fibrillation. Please correlate with full clinical picture.
